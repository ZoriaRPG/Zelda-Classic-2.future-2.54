// std.zh - 19th December, 2016
// Standard header for ZScript.
// Please don't edit this file. Instead, create a new header file for your
// quests' scripts,  add constants and procedures to that file,
// and import it separately.

//Proposed expansion for ZC 2.50.2
//12-JAN-2016

//Main Files
import "std_constants_2.54.zh"
import "std_functions_2.54.zh"
import "std_vars.zh"	//Basic array, and some generic handlers. Useful in preventing quest fixing/expansion issues. 

//ZScript string handling functions, akin to those found in C
//import "string.zh"
import "string_constants.zh" //Now imported from here. This prevents conflicts for those people
import "string_functions.zh" //who would import string.zh from a secondary source, as that file is now 
			     //empty, and the string.ch components load from here. 

//Memory Management Utilities
import "mem.zh"

//Shortcuts and Macros
import "std_shortcuts.zh" //Shortcuts for ZScript functions
import "std_constants_shortcuts.zh" //Shorter constants, requested by users.
