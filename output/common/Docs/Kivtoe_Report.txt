Kivtoe RoH Quest REPORT 1; 3rd-Dec-2016

Playing RoH Open Beta, Demo 1
Quest has no header, title, author.
Screen 39 (with shop cave): Player can enter without a sword, and goryias?
---> Player with no sword can be boxed in by tough enemies, meaning death, if they enter the cave hoping to find a sword.
Screen 48: Put the tops of the trees on layer 3, to allow walking behind them. :p
2B: String in shop is not set up so that words do not break on lines. Also, silly.
2B: Warp return from shop is not set properly. Move the warp return to be over the cave combo.
2A: Warp return from shop is not set properly (again) . Move the warp return to be over the cave combo.
L1: Really, bait rooms in L1?
L1: Serious bug: If you go to the goriya without bait, and backtrack, the spikes aren't down.
---> That room needs to be a permanent trigger.
L1 Passageway from start to spike room: The combos used for a background are walkable.

---> You need to make the top row of 'background bricks' solid, and the bottom row solid on the top.
---> The 'walkable row' combos should have solidity like this, where the X are solid quadrants:
   [x][x]
   [ ][ ]
4B: Why is the bomerang trigger a tree?
4B: Warp return from Potion or Heart, isn't near the cave combo. Move to be over the cave combo.
West, North, East, West; No hint?

I've been on every screen in the game that I can access. Is there no sword? What am I missing here?

The dungeon requires the sword to progress, or the bait; but you start with no money, and there is no way to
kill enemies to make money to buy the bait.

So, if the sword is in L1, as I expected, then get rid of the bait room.

Playing Beta 0.01.4.2

Trying this, as it might be newer?
Screen 4A: Walk to the right (4B) into darkness. Is this older than the public demo?

It sure is.

You should put version IDs on the public demos in the same way as the beta, so that it's possible to know what is newer.
