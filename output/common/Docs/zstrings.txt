| STRING CONTROL CODES        |
+-----------------------------+

Enter these control codes into a message string for special formatting, effects, basic dialog
branching, or modification. (Henceforth, "X" denotes a number from 0
to 9999.)

+-----------------------------+
| FORMATTING CODES            |
+-----------------------------+

\1\X\X - Text Colour. Changes the following text to a certain colour. Argument 1 is the CSet, and argument 2 is the colour within that CSet. The text in the Preview Pane changes to reflect the addition and modification of this Control Code. 

\2\X - Text Speed. Changes the length of the delay between text characters appearing. If 0, text appears instantaneously. Argument 1 is the speed. 

\25 - New Line. Equivalent to pressing Enter in a document. Best used when text wrapping is enabled.

\32 through \126 - ASCII Character. Prints a character based on its ASCII code. For example, \91 allows you to display a backslash.

+-----------------------------+
| SWITCH CODES                |
+-----------------------------+

    (Note: If you switch to a string that hasn't been created yet, then ZC will act as if you switched to a string with no characters in it. )

\3\X\X\X - Goto If Screen Variable. If one of the Screen->D[] variables of the current screen is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the index into the screen's D array, argument 2 is the value, and argument 3 is the string to switch to. 

\4\X\X - Goto If Random. There is a one-in-(argument 1) chance that ZC switches to another string (argument 2). 

\5\X\X - Goto If Item. If Link has a certain item, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the item ID, and argument 2 is the string to switch to. 

\6\X\X\X - Goto If Counter. If a counter is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the counter, argument 2 is the value, and argument 3 is the string to switch to. 

\7\X\X\X - Goto If Counter %. If a counter is at or above a certain percentage of its maximum, then ZC switches to another string. 

\8\X\X - Goto If Triforce. If Link has acquired the Triforce from a certain level, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the level, and argument 2 is the string to switch to. 

\9\X\X - Goto If Triforce Count. If Link has acquired a certain number of Triforce pieces, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the quantity, and argument 2 is the string to switch to.

+-----------------------------+
| COUNTER UP/DOWN CODES       |
+-----------------------------+

\10\X\X - Counter Up. Increases a counter by a certain value. Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\11\X\X - Counter Down. Reduces a counter by a certain value. Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\12\X\X - Counter Set. Sets a counter to a certain value. Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\13\X\X - Counter Up %. Increases a counter by a certain percentage of its maximum. Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\14\X\X - Counter Down %. Reduces a counter by a certain percentage of its maximum. Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\15\X\X - Counter Set %. Sets a counter to a certain percentage of its maximum. Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\16\X - Give Item. An item is silently added to Link's inventory. Link does not hold up the item, and the item's Pickup Script does not run - though the item's counter modifications will still take effect. Argument 1 is the item ID. 

\17\X - Take Item. An item is removed from Link's inventory. The item's counter modifications will be undone when this occurs. Argument 1 is the item ID.

| WARP EFFECT CODES           |
+-----------------------------+

\26\X\X - Warp Link. Argument 1 is the DMap, Argument 2 is te Screen ID.
\27\X\X\X - Warp Link. Argument 1 is the DMap, Argument 2 is te Screen ID, Argument 3 is the Warp Return.
\28\X\X\X\X - Warp Link. Argument 1 is the DMap, Argument 2 is te Screen ID, Argument 3 is the Warp Return.
			 Argument 4 is a sound to play, using the sound ID from Quest->Qudio->SFX
\29\X\X\X\X\X - Warp Link. Argument 1 is the DMap, Argument 2 is te Screen ID, Argument 3 is the Warp Return.
			 Argument 4 is a sound to play, using the sound ID from Quest->Qudio->SFX
			 Argument 5 is a WARP EFFECT (see below).

Warp Return Values: 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C, 3 = D.
Warp Effect Types: 
		0: None
		1: Instant
		2: Instant (Blackout)
		3: Instant (Opening Wipe)
		4: Instant (Zap Effects)
		5: Instant (Wavy Effects)
		6: Reset Room
		7: Scrolling
