Added public link var zstringwarp , and an if(zstringwarp) statement to the Link class to support warping by string. -ZoriaRPG
Added SCCs for Warp, Warp2, and SetScreenD to zstrings. -Dimentio
Wrote functions for SCC cases MSGC_WARP, MSGC_WARPSQ, MSGC_SETSCRD. -ZoriaRPG

Added Link->UseWarpReturn to ZScript. -ZoriaRPG
Added handlers in the Link class: setWarpReturnSquare(int), getWarpReturnSquare(), getDirectItem(), getDirectItemA(), getDirectItemB(). -ZoriaRPG
Added Link->UsingItem, Link->usingItemA, Link->UsingItemB to ZScript. -ZoriaRPG
->These should return the item number being used, or -1. 
->Setting these does nothing. 

//b16

Added Link->WarpSound : The user may set this, and if it is not 0, this sound plays during Link->Warp and Link->PitWarp.-ZoriaRPG
Worked on do_warp()
Added debug info to do_warp

//b17
Stopped side warps playing warp sfx. -ZoriaRPG
Added Link->PlayWarpSound : This enables/prevents a sound from playing even if set. Should override for side warps, etc. 
Fixed Link->PlayWarpSound. Now it returns properly.  -ZoriaRPG
Added SCC for Warp without a return square. -ZoriaRPG
How the hell do we set tmpscr->warpreturnc or why is wrindex=(tmpscr->warpreturnc>>(8+(index*2)))&3; not working?!

New SCCs are:

/23/dmap/screen - Warps to dmap, screen
/24/dmap/screen/return - Warps to dmap, screen, using retur square 'return'; but the return square thing isn't working.
/26/reg/value - Sets Screen->D[reg] = value. 

Added bool isscriptedwarp and associated handlers to link.h and link.cpp. ( LinkClass::getScriptedWarp(), etc.)
Modified do_warp() and dowarp() to use isscriptedwarp for how warps by script set wtSCROLL warpreturnx[] and warpreturny[], thus:
	if(get_bit(quest_rules,qr_NOARRIVALPOINT))
            {
                if ( getScriptedWarp() ){
			setScriptedWarp(false);
			wrx=tmpscr->warpreturnx[wrindex];
			wry=tmpscr->warpreturny[wrindex];
		}
		else{
			wrx=tmpscr->warpreturnx[0];
			wry=tmpscr->warpreturny[0];
		}
            }
	    
//b18
Additional work on warping.
The SCC warps are buged. If the present screen is a screen 8 cave, Link warps into unknown space. -ZoriaRPG
Added checks for isscriptedwarp to LinkClass::dowarp(int,int)

//b19

Added Link->WarpEffect to set an in-built effect for Link->Warp -ZoriaRPG
Added Screen->ZapIn(), Screen->ZapOut, Screen->WavyIn(), Screen->WavyOut, and Screen->OpeningWipe -ZoriaRPG
	These replicate the animations from tilewarps, to call at any time (without warping).
Fixed return squares for Link->Warp
Added additional SCCs for warping, and rewrote some of the old ones.
Renumbered SCCs for warping (31, 32, 33, 34) and Scren->D (40)

//b20
Partially rewrote LinkClass::dowarp() to fix sound and dest issues. 
Renamed bool Link->PlayWarpSound to Link->SideWarpSounds
Added ClearSCCWarpValues and used it to clean up SCC warps. 
Added LinkClass::playpitwarpsfx and bool Link->PitWarpSounds to ZScript, to determine if pit warps play a sound
Added bool LinkClass::ispit , LinkClass:: void getIsPitWarp, bool setIsPitWarp. 
	These are used to determine if the warp is a ptwarp after all the other vars clear. 
Why don't we rewrite PitWarp; eh?
All new ZScript features, and warp sounds work.
SCC Warp features still require testing, and debugging. 
Updated zscript.txt and 2.54_New_Zscript.txt to reflect the changes and additions.
Updated 'std_constants' with new WARPFX_* values. 

PitWarpSound and SideWarpSound seem to be joined somehow. Check to see if any of the EVENTS in Link.cpp might
be causing this, such as the event that calls dowarp().

Discovered that zlaunch-w.exe will crash if zquest-w is not in its working path. -ZoriaRPG
