//b15

Added public link var zstringwarp , and an if(zstringwarp) statement to the Link class to support warping by string. -ZoriaRPG
Added SCCs for Warp, Warp2, and SetScreenD to zstrings. -Dimentio
Wrote functions for SCC cases MSGC_WARP, MSGC_WARPSQ, MSGC_SETSCRD. -ZoriaRPG

Added Link->UseWarpReturn to ZScript. -ZoriaRPG
Added handlers in the Link class: setWarpReturnSquare(int), getWarpReturnSquare(), getDirectItem(), getDirectItemA(), getDirectItemB(). -ZoriaRPG
Added Link->UsingItem, Link->usingItemA, Link->UsingItemB to ZScript. -ZoriaRPG
->These should return the item number being used, or -1. 
->Setting these does nothing. 

//b16

Added Link->WarpSound : The user may set this, and if it is not 0, this sound plays during Link->Warp and Link->PitWarp.-ZoriaRPG
Worked on do_warp()
Added debug info to do_warp

//b17
Stopped side warps playing warp sfx. -ZoriaRPG
Added Link->PlayWarpSound : This enables/prevents a sound from playing even if set. Should override for side warps, etc. 
Fixed Link->PlayWarpSound. Now it returns properly.  -ZoriaRPG
Added SCC for Warp without a return square. -ZoriaRPG
How the hell do we set tmpscr->warpreturnc or why is wrindex=(tmpscr->warpreturnc>>(8+(index*2)))&3; not working?!

New SCCs are:

/23/dmap/screen - Warps to dmap, screen
/24/dmap/screen/return - Warps to dmap, screen, using retur square 'return'; but the return square thing isn't working.
/26/reg/value - Sets Screen->D[reg] = value. 

Added bool isscriptedwarp and associated handlers to link.h and link.cpp. ( LinkClass::getScriptedWarp(), etc.)
Modified do_warp() and dowarp() to use isscriptedwarp for how warps by script set wtSCROLL warpreturnx[] and warpreturny[], thus:
	if(get_bit(quest_rules,qr_NOARRIVALPOINT))
            {
                if ( getScriptedWarp() ){
			setScriptedWarp(false);
			wrx=tmpscr->warpreturnx[wrindex];
			wry=tmpscr->warpreturny[wrindex];
		}
		else{
			wrx=tmpscr->warpreturnx[0];
			wry=tmpscr->warpreturny[0];
		}
            }
	    
//b18
Additional work on warping.
The SCC warps are buged. If the present screen is a screen 8 cave, Link warps into unknown space. -ZoriaRPG
Added checks for isscriptedwarp to LinkClass::dowarp(int,int)

//b19

Added Link->WarpEffect to set an in-built effect for Link->Warp -ZoriaRPG
Added Screen->ZapIn(), Screen->ZapOut, Screen->WavyIn(), Screen->WavyOut, and Screen->OpeningWipe -ZoriaRPG
	These replicate the animations from tilewarps, to call at any time (without warping).
Fixed return squares for Link->Warp
Added additional SCCs for warping, and rewrote some of the old ones.
Renumbered SCCs for warping (31, 32, 33, 34) and Scren->D (40)

//b20
Partially rewrote LinkClass::dowarp() to fix sound and dest issues. 
Renamed bool Link->PlayWarpSound to Link->SideWarpSounds
Added ClearSCCWarpValues and used it to clean up SCC warps. 
Added LinkClass::playpitwarpsfx and bool Link->PitWarpSounds to ZScript, to determine if pit warps play a sound
Added bool LinkClass::ispit , LinkClass:: void getIsPitWarp, bool setIsPitWarp. 
	These are used to determine if the warp is a ptwarp after all the other vars clear. 
Why don't we rewrite PitWarp; eh?
All new ZScript features, and warp sounds work.
SCC Warp features still require testing, and debugging. 
Updated zscript.txt and 2.54_New_Zscript.txt to reflect the changes and additions.
Updated 'std_constants' with new WARPFX_* values. 

PitWarpSound and SideWarpSound seem to be joined somehow. Check to see if any of the EVENTS in Link.cpp might
be causing this, such as the event that calls dowarp(). 13/Dec/2016

Discovered that zlaunch-w.exe will crash if zquest-w is not in its working path. -ZoriaRPG

//b21
I appear to have fixed all of the warp sound conflicts, so we'll see what happens. -ZoriaRPG 14/Dec/2016
New public build. 

//b22
Saffith pointed out that SCC numbering was overflowing into ASCII escape char space. 
Fixed new SCC numbering, and rearranged.-Z 15/Dec/2016
	Changed the SCC IDs for new SCCs as follows:
	\18 Screen->D
	\19 SetScreenD(screen,reg,value)
	\23 SetDmapScreenD(dmap,screen,reg,value)

	\26 Warp(dmap,screen)
	\27 Warp(dmap,screen,return)
	\28 Warp(dmap,screen,return,sound)
	\29 Warp(dmap,screen,return,sound,effect)
Added Link->Eaten, Link->Extend, Link->SetTile(int,int,int,int) -Z 15/Dec/2016
Added constants for LSPRITE_* (Link Sprite) and cleaned some things in std_constants.


//b23
Added temporary stuff for Link->SetExtend(int,in6t,int), Link->GetExtend(int,int) -Z
Fixed Link->Extend not setting all dirs. -Z 15/Dec/2016
I suggest droping the SCC for GetScreenD, as Screen->D and DMapScreenD should suffice. -Z
I would also cut two of the warp functions to save space. -Z
Link->SetTile(i,i,i.i) isn't workin. Saffith says it's because of how Link is drawn. This may be true,
	but I suspect that my stack functions are also rubbish. -Z 16/Dec/2016
	These may need to wait until 2.55, as there are more important facets to worry about, when I'm wasting
	30+ hours recompiling to test changes. -Z 16/Dec/2016
	I'd still like to partially rewrite pit and side warps, and give each a unique sound var, so that I can
	dispose of this boolean flag and shared soud silliness. -Z
Disabled the ability to call Link->GetExtend(i,i) and Link->SetExtend(i,i,i). -Z 16/Dec/2016
	These were returning errors: 
		Couldn't find function label #1820
		Couldn't find function label #1821
Link->SetTile started generating a SP error. Calling it would hang ZC. Tried a new fix.-Z 16/Dec/2016
Updated docs. 

//b24
Worked on Link->SetTile, Link->GetExtend, Link->SetExtend -Z

//b25
Chaned Link->SetExtend() to Link->GetLinkExtend() and Link->GetExtend() to Link->SetLinkExtend().
	This should prevent issues with internal labels. -Z
	
//b26
Some minor opcode revisions for GetLinkExtend and SetLinkExtend. Note that they still are not correct, 
	but they no longer do *nothing at all*. -Z
