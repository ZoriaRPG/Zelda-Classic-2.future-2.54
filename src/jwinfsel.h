  *     The file selector.
  *
  *     By Shawn Hargreaves.
  *
  *     Guilherme Silveira and Theuzifan Sumachingun both independently
  *     modified it to only list valid drive letters.
  *
  *     Adapted to "jwin" style by Jeremy Craner. Also added the "browser".
  *
  *     Version: 3/22/00
  *     Allegro version: 3.1x  (don't know if it works with WIP)
