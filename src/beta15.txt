Added public link var zstringwarp , and an if(zstringwarp) statement to the Link class to support warping by string. -ZoriaRPG
Added SCCs for Warp, Warp2, and SetScreenD to zstrings. -Dimentio
Wrote functions for SCC cases MSGC_WARP, MSGC_WARPSQ, MSGC_SETSCRD. -ZoriaRPG

Added Link->UseWarpReturn to ZScript. -ZoriaRPG
Added handlers in the Link class: setWarpReturnSquare(int), getWarpReturnSquare(), getDirectItem(), getDirectItemA(), getDirectItemB(). -ZoriaRPG
Added Link->UsingItem, Link->usingItemA, Link->UsingItemB to ZScript. -ZoriaRPG
->These should return the item number being used, or -1. 
->Setting these does nothing. 

//b16

Added Link->WarpSound : The user may set this, and if it is not 0, this sound plays during Link->Warp and Link->PitWarp.-ZoriaRPG
Worked on do_warp()
Added debug info to do_warp

//b17
Stopped side warps playing warp sfx. -ZoriaRPG
Added Link->PlayWarpSound : This enables/prevents a sound from playing even if set. Should override for side warps, etc. 
Fixed Link->PlayWarpSound. Now it returns properly.  -ZoriaRPG
Added SCC for Warp without a return square. -ZoriaRPG
How the hell do we set tmpscr->warpreturnc or why is wrindex=(tmpscr->warpreturnc>>(8+(index*2)))&3; not working?!

New SCCs are:

/23/dmap/screen - Warps to dmap, screen
/24/dmap/screen/return - Warps to dmap, screen, using retur square 'return'; but the return square thing isn't working.
/26/reg/value - Sets Screen->D[reg] = value. 

Added bool isscriptedwarp and associated handlers to link.h and link.cpp. ( LinkClass::getScriptedWarp(), etc.)
Modified do_warp() and dowarp() to use isscriptedwarp for how warps by script set wtSCROLL warpreturnx[] and warpreturny[], thus:
	if(get_bit(quest_rules,qr_NOARRIVALPOINT))
            {
                if ( getScriptedWarp() ){
			setScriptedWarp(false);
			wrx=tmpscr->warpreturnx[wrindex];
			wry=tmpscr->warpreturny[wrindex];
		}
		else{
			wrx=tmpscr->warpreturnx[0];
			wry=tmpscr->warpreturny[0];
		}
            }
	    
//b18
Additional work on warping.
The SCC warps are buged. If the present screen is a screen 8 cave, Link warps into unknown space. -ZoriaRPG
Added checks for isscriptedwarp to LinkClass::dowarp(int,int)

//b19

Added Link->WarpEffect to set an in-built effect for Link->Warp -ZoriaRPG
Added Screen->ZapIn(), Screen->ZapOut, Screen->WavyIn(), Screen->WavyOut, and Screen->OpeningWipe -ZoriaRPG
	These replicate the animations from tilewarps, to call at any time (without warping).
